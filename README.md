### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ryan, a DevOps Engineer, based in and around London, UK.

### Technologies

In my day job, I mostly work with:
- Java
- MongoDB
- Apache Kafka
- Apache ZooKeeper
- gRPC / Armeria framework
- Google Cloud Platform (GCE, GCS, Cloud Operations, GKE)

Outside of my day job, I dabble in all things tech, including:
- Exploring retro computing / computer history
- Attempts at learning Rust/Golang/other languages
- Other silly ideas that I end up getting an urge to build (see VM-OS)
